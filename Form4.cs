It simplifies the process of converting between bodyweight and dose, allowing for quick and efficient calculations. Please review the following sections to better understand how to use the app effectively.\r\n\r\nGetting Started:\r\n\r\nHome Page - Fast-Lane Items:\r\nThe home page provides fast-lane calculations for frequently used medications and strengths, such as paracetamol (250mg/5ml and 120mg/5ml) and ibuprofen (100mg/5ml). Simply select the desired medication and strength to calculate the recommended dose based on the patient's bodyweight.\r\n\r\nAuto-Copy Option:\r\nEnabling the \"Auto-copy\" option from the settings menu allows you to automatically copy the generated dosage instructions to your clipboard when selecting a fast-lane item. This streamlines the process of pasting instructions into your dispensing software.\r\n\r\nAuto-Minimize Feature:\r\nWith the \"Auto-minimize\" feature enabled, the application will automatically minimize after copying dosage instructions. This makes it convenient for you to switch to your dispensing software and process the copied instructions without manually minimizing the app.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Calculator:\r\n\r\nAccessing the Advanced Calculator:\r\nFrom the main menu, navigate to the \"Advanced Calculator\" section. Here, you can enter a specific dose in milliliters and select the relevant medication and strength. The app will help you convert this dose to an ideal body weight for the patient and provide conversion options.\r\n\r\nCopying Instructions:\r\nSimilar to the fast-lane items, you can copy the dosage instructions generated by the advanced calculator. This is useful when you need to apply the converted dosage in your dispensing software.\r\n\r\nManual Calculator:\r\n\r\nAccessing the Manual Calculator:\r\nIn the main menu, select the \"Manual Calculator\" section. Here, you can calculate a customized dosage based on patient-specific information. Enter the patient's bodyweight in kilograms, the recommended dose per kilogram for the medication, and the medication's strength in mg/5ml. The app will provide you with the recommended dosage for the patient.\r\nImportant Notes:\r\n\r\nThe Dose Calculator application provides accurate calculations based on recommended doses from the NZF website. However, individual patient factors may impact dosing requirements. Always exercise clinical judgment when using the calculated doses.\r\n\r\nThe application is not a replacement for professional medical advice. Use the app as a tool to support your decision-making, but consult with qualified healthcare professionals for personalized patient care.\r\n\r\nSupport and Feedback:\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any technical issues or have suggestions for improving the Dose Calculator application, please contact our support team at pr.viky@gmail.com. Your feedback is valuable in enhancing the user experience.\r\n\r\nThank you for using the Dose Calculator app to streamline medication dose calculations.
